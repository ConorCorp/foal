Version 4.1 of [Foal](https://foalts.org/) is out!

<!--truncate-->

## Better logging

Foal now features a true logging system. Full documentation can be found [here](/docs/common/logging).

### New recommended configuration

It is recommended to switch to this configuration to take full advantage of the new logging system.

*config/default.json*
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "loggerFormat": "foal"
  }
}
```

*config/development.json*
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "logger": {
      "format": "dev"
    }
  }
}
```

## Request IDs

On each request, a request ID is now generated randomly. It can be read through `ctx.request.id`.

If the `X-Request-ID` header exists in the request, then the header value is used as the request identifier.
