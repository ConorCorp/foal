Version 3.0 of [Foal](https://foalts.org/) is finally there!

It's been a long work and I'm excited to share with you the new features of the framework ðŸŽ‰ . The upgrading guide can be found [here](/docs/upgrade-to-v3).

Here are the new features and improvements of version 3!

<!--truncate-->

## Full support of TypeORM v0.3

> For those new to Foal, TypeORM is the default ORM used in all new projects. But you can use any other ORM or query builder if you want, as the core framework is ORM independent.

TypeORM v0.3 provides greater typing safety and this is something that will be appreciated when moving to the new version of Foal.

The v0.3 version of TypeORM has a lot of changes compared to the 0.2 version though. Features such as the `ormconfig.json` file have been removed and functions such as `createConnection`, `getManager` or `getRepository` have been deprecated.

A lot of work has been done to make sure that `@foal/typeorm`, new projects generated by the CLI and examples in the documentation use version 0.3 of TypeORM without relying on deprecated functions or patterns.

In particular, the connection to the database is now managed by a file `src/db.ts` that replaces the older `ormconfig.json`.

## Code simplified

- fetchUser
- Parameters of the upload hook
- active record vs data mapper

## Better typing

- AJV types
- File upload in the controler method
- fetchUser: JS and TS types
- GraphQL

## Closer to the standards of the JS ecosystem

- `null` value in contexts to be closer to ORM standards
- npm run dev
- config behavior similar to dotenv

## More open to other ORMs

- Scripts not tied to TypeORM
- Permission system not tied to TypeORM

## Smaller packages

- Packages compiled to ES2021
- Smaller dependencies such as the one for AWS S3

## Up-to-date with the latest versions of Node and npm dependencies

## Some bug fixes

- the `undefined` values in the configuration
